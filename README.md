# Dono-Application: Where giving is a social experience. üëê

## Overview

Our application is a social media charity platform for Non Profit Organizations and potential donors. We created a Twitter-esque experience that will make it easier for more people to take part in funding charitable causes.

We wanted to enable discussions, and to provide a social platform where one can easily interact with Non Profit Organizations. Which we hope will lead to lasting support while allowing the user to become more engaged in the projects/programs/causes that they care about.

AS a non profit organization,
WE WANT an online platform decluttered from the normal social experiences,
SO THAT people can follow our work, and are able to more easily share causes they truly care about.
